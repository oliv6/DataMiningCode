# The CyberQ Hackathon

<p>
  I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the CyberQ Hackathon, part of the CyberQ: Security in the Quantum Era Conference. Competing solo in this global event, I was thrilled to secure a position among the top 20 participants. This intense competition focused on addressing challenges in Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and hybrid cryptographic solutions, offering a platform to apply and expand my knowledge in cybersecurity.

<h2>
  Day 1: Exploring Post-Quantum Cryptographic Standards
</h2> 

  <h3>Hands-On with ML-KEM and ML-DSA</h3>
  <p>I began by diving into Python libraries such as kyber-py and dilithium-py, implementing cryptographic standards ML-KEM (FIPS 203) and ML-DSA (FIPS 204). This phase included:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Generating key pairs and shared secret keys using ML-KEM.</b></li>
      <li><b>Computing and verifying digital signatures with ML-DSA.</b></li>
      <li><b>Experimenting with both high- and low-level APIs to understand their mechanics.</b></li>
  </ul>

<p><b>Secure Message Encryption</b>
In the next phase, I established secure communications with servers, fetched public keys, and encrypted messages using one-time-pad and AES algorithms. I also analyzed the security needs of different organizations, selecting the most suitable security levels and encryption methods.</p>


<h2>
  Day 1: Cryptanalysis and Exploiting Vulnerabilities
</h2> 

  <p>In a shift from cryptographic design to cryptanalysis, I identified flaws in cryptographic implementations, including:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Recovering secret keys from insecure parameters.</b></li>
      <li><b>Exploiting weaknesses in rejection sampling and domain separation.</b></li>
      <li><b>Revealing vulnerabilities to timing attacks.</b></li>
  </ul>

<p>This phase sharpened my ability to detect and exploit weaknesses in cryptographic systems, an essential skill in securing real-world applications.</p>



<h2>
  Day 2: Migrating to Post-Quantum Standards
</h2> 

  <h3>Algorithm Selection and Protocol Implementation</h3>
  <p>On the second day, I tackled challenges related to adopting post-quantum cryptography standards, including:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Selecting appropriate algorithms based on bandwidth, object sizes, and desired security levels.</b></li>
      <li><b>Implementing quantum-secure TLS protocols and hybrid protocols to ensure robust security.</b></li>
  </ul>

<p>This phase highlighted the practical difficulties of transitioning to post-quantum systems, offering valuable insights into migration strategies.</p>

<h2>
  Key Takeaways and Achievements
</h2> 

  <p>The CyberQ Hackathon was an enlightening experience that allowed me to:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Master advanced post-quantum cryptographic standards.</b></li>
      <li><b>Gain hands-on expertise in secure communication and cryptanalysis.</b></li>
      <li><b>Understand the complexities of transitioning to quantum-resilient systems.</b></li>
  </ul>

<p>Additionally, I was thrilled to receive an email from the event organizers recognizing me as one of the top 20 participants globally. Competing solo and achieving this distinction in a challenging and highly competitive event was a rewarding accomplishment.

This competition not only strengthened my technical skills but also reaffirmed my passion for staying ahead in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.</p>
